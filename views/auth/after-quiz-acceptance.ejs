            <p id="acceptanceSmallText"   >
                <span>
                    <%= user.house %>.

                I think you already know Mr. Ollivander, he already sent you a 
                welcoming gift and he left a message that says:<br>
                    "The wand chooses the Wizard, <span><%= user.username %></span>!
                        It's not always clear why. 
                            But I think it is clear that we can expect great things from you."
            </p>
                
            <p  id="acceptanceSmallText"  >
                So let's see what you got!
            </p>
                
            <p  id="acceptanceSmallText"  >
                Aaa, 
                <span>
                <%= user.wand %>
                </span>
                ! Perfect! Make sure you will use it to the fullest!
